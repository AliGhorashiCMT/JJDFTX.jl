# JJDFTX.jl
[![Build status][ci-status-img]][ci-status-url][![Coverage][codecov-img]][codecov-url]

Formerly jdftx_to_plot. Was renamed since the original name did not reflect the broader goals of the package and also because naming conventions in Julia dictate that the module name be uppercase. 

Provisionally, the package stands for Joint, Joint Density Functional Theory and is written to be compatible with output binary and text files from JDFTX. 

While this module is being updated, the documentation from jdftx_to_plot can be used as a temporary reference.
